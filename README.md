Doodles I doodled using fixed-width text.

Mostly, if not entirely, UTF-8.

.ddw files are DarkDraw drawings
.dur files are DurDraw drawings
.ans files are generic escape-coded text, viewable in most terminals

These drawings make heavy use of semigraphical characters and may be rendered differently than intentended in many fonts/terminals.
They should all be rendered more or less correctly by terminals built with libVTE, which will disregard any font's semigraphical glyphs and render these characters consistently with any font (GNOME-terminal, XFCE4-terminal, ghostty, etc)
